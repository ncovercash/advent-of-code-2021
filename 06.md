# Day 6

## Part 1

Fish! In this part, I made a vector to hold the entire population then, for each
"day" (iteration of the main loop), incremented and added new fish per the
rules.

## Part 2

For this, larger numbers were needed (as my solution was approximately 1.7
trillion lanternfish, well above `MAX_INT` (usually 2.37 billion)). To achieve
this, I used `long long` which was enough for this. Additionally, a vector this
large would be ridiculous (and extremely slow to traverse, not to mention the
memory usage), if it were even possible. Therefore, upon re-analysis of the
problem, I saw that the fish did not need to be stored separately and instead
could be grouped by their counters. Each time a fish goes below `0`, they go
back to `7` and more fish form with `9`, creating the arithmetic used in the
loop there. This made the n-day simulation take only O(n) time -- a great
improvement.

This was by far a more elegant solution and part 1 can be solved using this as
well. In fact, part 2 is even faster (with 256 days) than part 1 (with 80)!
