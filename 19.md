# Day 19

## Part 1

This one was a doozy. However, to be fair, I could have saved myself hours of
time if I had properly encoded all 24 cube rotations (`getAllTransformations`)
-- once I got that, things were much more straightforward.

After reading in all the points around a scanner, I found every possible
orientation of those points. With this, I compared each orientation to a base
orientation of a main scanner (scanner 0 at first, in the `getOverlap` method).
If I found at least twelve points with a constant offset from the basis' points,
I knew this was the correct orientation and the offset I found was the relative
position of the other scanner.

With this information, I made a `Map` which held a collection of points, the
relative positions of all the scanners in that map, and their transformations.
This was then combined with other maps as I found more overlapping scanners
until, eventually, all of the scanners were in one map.

## Part 2

For this, I simply added a method to find the largest Manhattan Distance within
a Map and called that after all scanners had been consolidated and mapped.
