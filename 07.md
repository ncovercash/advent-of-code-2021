# Day 7

## Part 1

For this one, all that needed to be done to calculate fuel usage was find the
absolute value of the current position. Then, a binary search was used to find
the optimal value (as the overall fuel to distance graph should be parabolic in
shape).

## Part 2

With part 1, the only change needed was the calculation of fuel. Knowing that
the sum of i from i=0..n is n\*(n+1)/2, this was easy to calculate.
