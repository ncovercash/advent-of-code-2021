# Day 1

## Part 1

For this, the task was quite simple: computing the number of decreases. Since the output was positive, I used a sentinel value of `-1` for the `lastInput`, allowing me to simply compare each pair of inputs as they were streamed in.

## Part 2

This was a rough extension of the previous part. However, instead of a single input, I had three, one for the three previous inputs (as two sliding averages needed four inputs).
