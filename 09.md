# Day 9

## Part 1

To find a low point, the `isLow` method would check the four adjacent squares to
make sure they were >= the given point.

This simple algorithm just checks all points for lowness.

## Part 2

For this, I made a `getBasinSize` method which go through each point from the
low point (center), adding all adjacent ones to a list. These were stored in a
`unordered_set` with a custom hashing function (for a pair of integers -- I do
not remember where I got this hash function from) to ensure uniqueness. With
this flood-fill type approach, the size of each basin was calculated; then,
simple sorting found the three largest.
