# Day 5

## Part 1

This one took some serious work (I had no idea `static` C++ members were initialized so strangely and caused so many obscure compiler errors). I attempted a number of ways to make this more efficient, however, eventually gave up and let this run all twelve seconds that brute force actually took.

## Part 2

This was the same, however, additional logic was added to account for sloped (diagonal) lines.  Instead of treating each line as a 1 unit wide box, I had to improve the collision logic to check if it was sloped, calculate `m`, then use that to check for collisions.
