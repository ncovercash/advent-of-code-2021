# Day 4

## Part 1

Bingo time! Reading the boards in was relatively straightforward: I made a holding array of values as they were read in (as they were across multiple lines); then, once they were all read in, I added them to a vector of all the boards.

With these boards, I went through the vector of called numbers, marking them (by setting the number to zero, as that would not be a valid number in the input) and checking for bingo (using goto to break out of the nested loops, [don't at me](https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~dab/cs1410/textbook/3.Control/goto.html)).

## Part 2

This was the same, however, instead of breaking upon the first board, this went through all calls (ensuring that boards only got bingo once and not considering them after).
