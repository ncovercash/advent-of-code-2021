# Day 3

## Part 1

In this task, I needed to analyze columns of bits.  To do this, I made vectors `numZeroes` and `numOnes` (sure, they could be arrays, and one calculated from the other, but where's the fun in that).  Each line I read in, I simply incremented the values; at the end, I performed the needed bit shifting and got the result.

## Part 2

For this part, things got pretty funky.  I stored all the lines as a separate vector; then, when it came to calculating the actual values, I copied these vectors (thank you C++ assignment operators for being _weird_), found which was maximal/minimal in the column, filtered, and restarted till only one was left.
